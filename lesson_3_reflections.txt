When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a project with multiple people and want to share the code so they can view/edit as well
then this would be an instance wheen you can create a remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-todate
with your remote repository?

It would be a good idea to be aware of what changes you are actually pulling into your codebase so you know what
changed. Also there might be instances where there are changes made in remote that you don't want in your local
repository which you can avoid by manually pulling from remote.
